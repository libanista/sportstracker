The SportsTracker Importer 0.5 
------------------------------

Overview:

This tool comes handy if you want to import a lot of Polar HRM files in the
SportsTracker (http://www.saring.de/sportstracker/index.html).

The Sportstracker is  pretty cool tool to control your trainning. It's not
done for importing mass data: the Sportstracker can import HRM file one by one
what it is very slow and boring. With this tool you can import all HRM files
at ones.


How does it works:


The SportsTrackes stores key information about sport activities in the simple
XML file ($HOME/exercises.xml). There are stored information about kind of
sport activity, date, time, duration, distance, avg speed and also the path to
appropriate HRM file. The SportsTrackes Importer reads given HRM files and
update XML file with information read from HRM files.



Background:

The SportsTracker Importer consits of two Python scripts:

	hrm2st.py
	hrmparser.py

The hrmparser.py is called from hrm2st.py for parsing HRM files. The
hrmparser.py scripts must be located in the same directory as hrm2st.py and
can be used separately.  See ./hrmparser.py --help for brief help.



Prerequisite:

The SportsTracker Importer is written in Python. It uses standard modules
which comes with python distribution except one: matplotlib. This module can
be obtained commonly (depends on operating system). For example in Ubuntu:
 
  sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib


  
Installation:
 
  wget http://physics.muni.cz/~polcar/sportstracker-importer-0.5.tgz
  tar -xzvf sportstracker-importer-0.5.tgz
  cd sportstracker-importer-0.5



Usage:


General usage can be described by:

   ./hrm2st.py [ OPTIONS ] FILE1.HRM [ FILE2.HRM  [...]]

Key options of the Sportstracker Importer are

    --output OUTPUT ..................... which file is used for output (SportsTracke XML)
    --force ............................. rewrite already existing OUTPUT file
    --sportType=SPORTTYPE ............... used SportsTrack sport type id
    --sportSubType=SPORTSUBTYPE ......... used SportsTrack subtype id
    --append ............................ add importerd data to old one (already present in OUTPUT)


Example of usage:

    ./hrm2st.py --verbose --append --force --output $HOME/.sportstracker/exercises.xml /PATH_TO_HRM_FILES/*.hrm


This command adds information from HRM files located in /PATH_TO_HRM_FILES/
directory to $HOME/.sportstracker/exercises.xml file. Skips already presented
files.  Note that the needed sport type and subtype ID's can be seen in the
sport-types.xml (located in $HOME/.sportstracker/).



Disclaimer:

The SportsTracker Importer was tested on Ubuntu 9.10. Use on your own
responsibility.  Always backup your $HOME/.sportstracker/exercises.xml before
use SportsTracker Importer.
